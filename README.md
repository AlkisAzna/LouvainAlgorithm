# Python Louvain's Algorithm

This project implements louvain's algorithm to a network Graph to find communitiesn with Nodes having strong relationships between them

Two types of Graphs are implemented:
- Karate Club Graph (Specific Nodes and Edges)
- MultiGraph (User inserts the number of Nodes - edjes created randomly)

The project exploits the louvain's algorithm library to implement the algorithm to our proposed Network Graphs

## Prerequisites
-Python 3.11
-Libraries:
  * networkX
  * random
  * python-louvain
  * community
  * matplotlib
  
## Results

The project produces 4 Figures and 2 modularity values, one for each case scenario prior and after the implementation of the algorithm.
