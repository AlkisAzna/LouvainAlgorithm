# Python Louvain's Algorithm

This project implements louvain's algorithm to a network Graph to find communitiesn with Nodes having strong relationships between them

Two types of Graphs are implemented:
- Karate Club Graph (Specific Nodes and Edges)
- MultiGraph (User inserts the number of Nodes - edjes created randomly)

The project exploits the louvain's algorithm library to implement the algorithm to our proposed Network Graphs
